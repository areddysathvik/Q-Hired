-started with HRs Registration
-implemented Hrs Registration
-found {bootstrap and base template implementation} and reimplementated Registration
-implemented Log in System
-find it useful to seperate apps for better structuring
    - content : shows the Logged in Hr's Posted Jobs, and also allows them to Create Job
    - users: registartion and Log In 
    - applications: applicants can apply with job id without any sign in required.

-though of creating profile section giving Hr's the update ability
-got weird Behaviour when Hr try to update their details and after debugging 
    found that created additional fields to user MODEL is not working so 
    created a CustomUser MODEL and reimplementated
-implemented Appications View so that the HR can see the applications
-for applicants to apply to various created dynamic urls which they can do that by 
routing to this url "apply/job_id" 
-found performance lag and after searching for optimizations found the pagination concept for display n jobs at at page 
rather than showing all jobs at a time
-tried 3 different ways to for resume screeing logics
    -1. Glove
    -2. BERT Word EMbeddings with cosiene similarity ( Average)
    -3. SentEmbeddings with cosiene similarity
- found the 3rd way effective and wrote logic in functions
- found performance issues and ambiguity issues so, encapsulated everything into Classes and i am satisfied with the results
- modified Applications Saving Logic into
    -from directly saving to save then apply screeing logic if satisfied then do nothing else delete the applications
